    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <h3>Base camp ‚õ∫Ô∏è</h3>

    <p>
      We will be based at Doc's Onamalutu campground.
      This is a large grassy paddock surrounded by trees and a modest river.
      There are flush toilets and a "please boil" water supply.
      Pretty swish.
      Bring your favourite tent/car camping setup.
      Camping costs $10 per person per night and there will probably be a campground host to collect your cash and leave passive aggressive notes about noodles in the outdoor sink.
      No fires and no dogs sorry.
      There is no cell service at camp but every day we will be either up a hill or passing through girlfriend/boyfriend corner.
    </p>

    <h3>The daily rhythm</h3>

    <p>
      Each evening we spin the wheel to decide the following day's adventure üé≤
    </p>

    <p>
      We roll out of camp by 9am each day, sometimes a little earlier when there's more admin.
      There are two days we ride from camp but otherwise we will drive/car pool.
      Two days will require some extra shuttle logistics but we'll discuss that the night before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plan to be self sufficient or buddy up for food, spares, camping, and safety equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      You do your own food.
      Bring snacks and lunch for out on the trail, and plan for dinner back at base camp.
      You might also want to bring salty yums and a victory beer to stash in a creek at the road end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pace is usually pretty casual but the hills are big so we will get spread out.
      Expect to be out in the forest for 5 to 7 hours each day.
      Going up we will typically splinter into smaller groups and regroup a few times like lunch or at the top.
      Not all tops are summits, but all summits are tops, eh what?!
      Sometimes we'll leave bikes at the obvious leave bikes spot and walk the last bit to the top for views and completist satisfaction ‚úÖ
    </p>

    <p>
      Tuesday night is taco night (obviously) so bring your best Mexican-themed camping food, drinks, and attire.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are glorious rivers most days to swim in and freshen up, or the stream back at camp to keep the stinkies at bay.
      There is no hot water unless someone brings a portable jacuzzi.
      Actually that would be ace, thanks friend!
    </p>

    <h3>Heli day</h3>

    <p>
      Wednesday (Thursday backup) will be helicopter day üöÅ
    </p>

    <p>
      It could get cancelled due to cloud or bad weather.
      Morning valley cloud can occur when the weather is perfect too, so be prepared for another day of pushing instead!
    </p>

    <p>
      Payment for the helicopter is usually cash only and will be $150-$200 per person depending on numbers.
      If that's a bit spendy you can self-propel from the bottom to meet the rest of us.
      No judgement, it will still be a good adventure.
    </p>

    <h3>The trails (and terrain)</h3>

    <p>
      All the trails this year are within the Mount Richmond Forest Park.
      The hills are steep and rocky and mostly covered in beech trees with exposed summits in the alpine at around the 1500m mark.
      Base camp is at 100m, you can work out the difference.
      Trails are mostly knobbly old walking tracks stacked with grade 4/5/6 sections.
      Walking some sections is sensible and encouraged, see the safety note below...
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically we drive to a road end and start out on a very pleasant grade 2 ride through the forest.
      This will promptly end with a grade 5 carry out of a creek/river.
      After that the gradient usually relents a bit and it's a social walk/push/carry through open beech forest.
      Rocky bits start to appear higher up and eventually the trees give way to huge views and more rocky bits.
      Then we turn around and head back down.
      Session some tricky bits, walk some really tricky bits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even on heli day and the two shuttle days expect over 500m of climbing.
      One of the shuttle days requires good weather due of tricky navigation and big mountain exposure, but it's an incredible descent off the back of a sixteener that you've never ridden ü§©
    </p>

    <h3>Supplies</h3>

    <p>
      Renwick is around 15 minutes drive from camp for modest supplies of food and fuel.
      We will also pass through Havelock twice one of the days.
      No Nelson visits this year.
    </p>

    <h3>Safety</h3>

    <p>
      Nothing has ever gone wrong at Richmond Roulette.
      Over the years we have not had multiple fractures or dislocations.
      We have never had any concussions.
      We have not had multiple emergency helicopter evacuations.
      The rivers have never risen and blocked our route.
      No-one has been stung by wasps or drained of their blood by sand flies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aaaactually every one of those sentences is the opposite.
      There have been serious injuries.
      This is remote-ish territory and rescue can be difficult.
      Some of the trails have very technical sections.
      Some sections no-one will ride.
      That's ok.
      Be sensible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our biggest hazards are gravity and the weather.
      Do bring some first aid gear.
      Between us all we will have various first aid kits, first aid experience, and a few PLBs.
      A waterproof jacket is probably the most important piece of safety kit in the high country.
      Waterproof pants are good too.
